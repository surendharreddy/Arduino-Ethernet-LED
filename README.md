#Controling LED from a Webserver built using Arduino Uno and Arduino Ethernet Shield.

###In this tutorial we're controlling an LED by using a Webserver which is built using Arduino Uno and Arduino Ethernet Shield.

Actually, the Arduino and Ethernet shield serves up a web page that allows an LED to be switched on and off. The LED is connected to one of the Arduino pins. This circuit is very simple and it's given below.

Here we've few things to do before getting all the work done.

1. Connect the Arduino Ethernet Shield to Arduino Uno
2. Get the IP Address for Arduino Ethernet Shield.

3. Then, connect the LED to Arduino Ethernet Sield as shown in the circuit.
4. Download the code and upload it to Arduino.

5. Now you'll see that Arduino Webserver serves the HTMl page, navigate to that page using IP and then control your LED.
